\usage{
reconcileGeographies(polyA, polyB, idA = NULL, idB = NULL,
  project_crs = NULL, dist_buffer = 5, min_inters_area = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{polyA}{The first spatial polygon object.}

\item{polyB}{The second spatial polygon object.}

\item{idA}{The name of the id column in the first object. If not provided, the first column is assume to be the ID.}

\item{idB}{The name of the id column in the second object. If not provided, the first column is assume to be the ID.}

\item{project_crs}{The EPSG coordinate system. The unit must be the metre.}

\item{dist_buffer}{The distance for the buffer. Default is 5 metres.}

\item{min_inters_area}{The minimum intersection area for to two geometries to be intersecting. Default is 1 m2.}
}
